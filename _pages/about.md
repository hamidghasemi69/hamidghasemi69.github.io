I currently work as a **Principal Data Scientist** in Actionable Analytic group at [the Office of the University Provost at Arizona State University](https://provost.asu.edu/) where I maintain the whole end-to-end machine learning model development to deployment. Prior to my current position, I was a senior machine learning scientist at Overstock. 

I have obtained my Bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Tehran (ranked 1st university in Iran) Summer 2009, Masters and Ph.D in Electrical Engineering from the University of Iowa, Summer 2016.

For more information, please refer to my **resume** here.
