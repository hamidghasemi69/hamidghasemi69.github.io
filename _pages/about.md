I am Hamidreza Ghasemi Damavandi, currently serving as a **Principal Data Scientist** in the Actionable Analytics group within [the Office of the University Provost at Arizona State University](https://provost.asu.edu/). In this role, I oversee the complete lifecycle of machine learning projects, from model development to deployment. Previously, I worked as a Senior Machine Learning Scientist at Overstock.

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en) (Ranked as the top university overall and the second-best in technology in Iran.) in Summer 2013 and later completed my Master's and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at the [University of Iowa](https://uiowa.edu/) in Summer 2016.

For additional details, please see my [**resume**](../files/resume.pdf).


FYI - I am a **U.S. citizen** and do not require visa sponsorship for any role.

Research Interest
